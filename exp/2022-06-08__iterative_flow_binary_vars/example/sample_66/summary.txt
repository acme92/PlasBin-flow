### Determination of putative plasmid contigs

37180 genes (from /project/6007976/wg-anoph/Plasmids-Assembly/data/2018-06-12__MOB-suite_benchmark_genes/all_genes.fasta) have to be searched.

After filtering, 3819 (of 7517) gene matches remain, covering 28 (of 110) contigs and 3730 genes.

The assembly graph of putative plasmid contigs consists of 29 contigs.
